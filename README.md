## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment and monitoring of a cloud-hosted application on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, with a focus on **cost optimisation, security, and service availability**.  
It aligns with **Google Associate Cloud Engineer** skills and directly supports my application for cloud engineering roles.  

---

## üöÄ Project Objectives
- Deploy a web application on **GCP Compute Engine**  
- Enable secure access using **firewall rules**  
- Configure **Cloud Storage** and **IAM roles** for data security  
- Set up **Cloud Monitoring & Budget Alerts** to manage costs and availability  
- Document the process for learning and portfolio use

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Firewall Rules
- Created firewall rule: `allow-8080`  
- Opened TCP port `8080` to external traffic

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Flask App
Flask App Code (`app.py`):

```python```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello from GCP VM!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Instructions
SSH into the VM and run:

Install Flask (if not already installed)

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-flask

Start the Flask app using this command
python3 app.py

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cloud Storage Integration

- Created a new bucket: `joel-gcp-cost-bucket`
- Location: Regional (`us-central1`)
- Storage class: Standard
- Access control: Uniform
- Uploaded object: `Hello.txt`
- Configured IAM: Granted **Storage Object Viewer** role for controlled access
- Verified access from VM using `gsutil`

#### Commands

```bash```
##### List bucket contents
gsutil ls gs://joel-gcp-cost-bucket

##### Copy file from bucket to VM
gsutil cp gs://joel-gcp-cost-bucket/Hello.txt .

##### Read file contents
cat Hello.txt
